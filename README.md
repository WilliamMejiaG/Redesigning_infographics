# Redesigning Infographics
The goal of this work is to create more effective visualizations from current data bases available publicly. The chosen data set was "Focus on what you eat, not whether your food is local" (https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/data-sets-2020/)(https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local).
The current infographic is this:

The code and the results are showed in this repository.
